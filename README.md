Weather Alerts

Program to send alerts out when specific weather conditions are met. 

Ideally aiming to fire alerts for the following circumstances:
1. Needing to cover fragile plants with frost bags
2. Needing to water plants during drought
3. Watching for bee swarms on pleasant days after several days of rain
4. Store Data of Current Weather for Further Visualization
5. Find good candidates for days with good bee inspection weather
